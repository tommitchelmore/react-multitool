## üöß Under Construction! üöß

Welcome to React Multitool - a (mainly hooks) utility library for React. It's still very much under construction, but a stable release is on the way. Please **don't** use this in any production code, and be aware that everything is subject to change at any time before v1.0.0. That said, please test it out, report bugs, suggest features or even [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) to the project.

## Installation üß∞

### npm

```bash
npm install react-multitool
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add react-multitool
```

## Hooks ü™ù

React Multitool provides several hooks that I've found myself writing over and over again - click each link to see the documentation for that hook.

[`useAsync`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useAsync) - manages the lifecycle states of an async function

[`useClickAway`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useClickAway) - detects when clicking outside of an element, useful for modals and dialogues.

[`useClipboard`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useClipboard) - wrapper around the browser clipboard API

[`useCounter`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useCounter) - a hook that counts up, with utilities such as looping and resetting.

[`useEvent`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useEvent) - adds and manages event listeners on DOM elements

[`useHover`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useHover) - detects when a user's mouse is within a DOM element

[`useLocalData`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useLocalData) - an abstraction on `useState` that persists and retrieves data in `localStorage`

[`useMouse`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useMouse) - returns the current mouse coordinates relative to the window or a DOM element

[`useOpen`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useOpen) - a wrapper around `useState` for handling modals and other open-close design patterns.

[`usePrevious`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/usePrevious) - holds the previous value of a variable

[`useQueue`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useQueue) - a wrapper around `useState` implementing a Queue ADT

[`useScrollLock`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useScrollLock) - utility hook to conditionally lock scrolling of the window or a scrollable DOM element.

[`useSet`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useSet) - a wrapper around `useState` implementing a state ADT

[`useStack`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/useStack) - a wrapper around `useState` implementing a Stack ADT
