## Hooks

React Multitool provides several hooks that I've found myself writing over and over again.

[`useClickAway`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/hooks/use-click-away) - detects when clicking outside of an element, useful for modals and dialogues.


[`useCounter`](https://github.com/tommitchelmore/react-multitool/wiki/hooks/use-counter) - a hook that counts up, with utilities such as looping and resetting.

[`useEvent`]() - adds and manages event listeners on DOM elements

[`useHover`]() - detects when a user's mouse is within a DOM element

[`useLocalData`]() - an abstraction on `useState` that persists and retrieves data in `localStorage`

[`useMouse`]() - returns the current mouse coordinates relative to the window or a DOM element

[`useOpen`]() - a wrapper around `useState` for handling modals and other open-close design patterns.

[`usePrevious`]() - holds the previous value of a variable

[`useQueue`]() - a wrapper around `useState` implementing a Queue ADT

[`useScrollLock`]() - utility hook to conditionally lock scrolling of the window or a scrollable DOM element.

[`useSet`]() - a wrapper around `useState` implementing a state ADT
